        <h1> My Favourite Hobby</h1>
        <p id="pihapto"> I like studying, reading books, math(especially the pythagorean theorem), figuring out the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle, geography and vexillology. I am in 4th grade and passed the PEAC test, actually many passed but they selected the top-scorers. There were 4 people in the entire school who were selected for the PEAC course and I was the top-scorer out of everyone in the school who took the test this year with 99%. From 5th grade to 6th grade I will be participating in the program, there are 6 courses and you can choose 4 to complete that year and we go on Thursday mornings.</p>
